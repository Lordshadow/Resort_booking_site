Welcome to Our Hotel Website!
Hello visitor, welcome back again! If you are new, it's nice to meet you.

I'm excited to share my new hotel room booking website with you. It was a fun and sometimes challenging experience developing it.

I have included the source folder for the project, along with a few screenshots and a video sample for your review.

I hope you like my project! Please feel free to leave comments and point out any mistakes you find on the website or any errors in my description. Your feedback is highly appreciated.

The technologies I used for this project are:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
React
Bootstrap
If you'd like to run this project, please follow these instructions:

Install VS Code, Node.js, and React properly. (Refer to YouTube tutorials if you have any doubts.)
Create a new React project in VS Code and install the react-router-dom package.
Replace the src folder of your newly created project with the src folder I have provided.
Follow these simple steps to run my project! :)
